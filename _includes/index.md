Hi, my name is Tyler Pflueger, and I am currently a super senior at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I currently work at Aviture as a Software Engineer.

I first took interest in programming thanks to the gift my parents gave me of the Gameboy. I was so intriqued that I asked my dad if he could make the video games and I would always draw up the ideas. The will to create video games made me passionate about learning programming. As I grew up, I tried and tried to learn programing but would always fail due to the overwhelming amount of work to even start. I finally was able to take programming classes and fell in love with it.

My current passion is using Mobile and Web to create unique experiences. Along the way, its always great to play with the latest technologies. In my spare time I play with new frameworks, work on mobile apps, and whatever other stereotypical college student does.
